# Rock, Paper, Scissors Console Game
Description: This application is a console game the user can play to enjoy the classic game of 'Rock, Paper, Scissors'. This application is built in vanilla Java and incorporates OOP principles and the concept of 'everything can be an object'.

## Technologies Used
1) IntelliJ IDE
2) Java

## Hurdles and Problems
One of the main issues I was facing was the concept that anything can be an object. The assignment was to make the Main Menu an object the user can interact with in order to be able to choose if they want to play the game, look at previous game history, or quit the application. It took a while to understand how I can make something like a main menu into an object. 

Another hurdle that I faced was sticking to DRY and KISS programming principles. When writing the code, it was difficult to concentrate on one task, and then refactor later to make the code better and more efficient.

## Solutions
How I overcame the problem of making the main menu an object was simple. I thought about what properties different properties a main menu would have, and then from there I generated getters and setters with the hlp of IntelliJ's generate code feature, and then I began writing methods to navigate through the main menu with taking user inputs to let the application know which methods to run depending on the users input. 

The solution for the other part is a matter of practicing ignorance. The main problem I was having was feature creep where I would be writing a method and then I would think about features I could implement or a new way to rewrite a method I wrote 30 lines of code ago. The solution was to practicing ignoring those thoughts. If feature creep came up, I would zoom in the screen so that i didn't have to see the previously written code and want the urge to rewrite it and make it better. It was simply better to leave it alone and finish my thought first and then go back later to fix it.
